    <h2>This is my version of a pineapple and curry fried rice dish served at my favorite Thai restaurant. 
        You might think that the flavors of curry and pineapple wouldn't go together, but they do.</h2>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>White Rice</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Pineapple Juice</li> 
        <li>Curry Powder</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Chicken Meat Cubed</li>
        <li>Medium Onion</li>
        <li>Diced Pineapple</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and rice in a saucepan over high heat; bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and all liquid has been absorbed, 
            20 to 25 minutes. Set rice aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk fish sauce, pineapple juice, and curry powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
            Cook and stir chicken and onion in hot oil until chicken is no longer pink and onions are translucent, 
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cooked rice, pineapple chunks, and curry mixture; cook and stir until rice is hot, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
